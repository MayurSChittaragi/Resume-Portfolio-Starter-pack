    "bio": "Hi there! I am Mayur! I've been coding for over 10 years now. As a budding Full Stack developer I've worked both with clones and other small scale applications. Along the journey I realised that I enjoyed development more than the DS questions or contests. With this passion, I am now on a journey to become a full stack developer. I really enjoy building applications which will be used by people for making their work easier. I hope to become successful in this world of web development by making some applications which can leave it's mark upon the world. I am currently looking for opportunities and projects in order to apply my knowledge and improve the same with each of these challenges.",
